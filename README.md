# Banner Component

This banner was created for Tumelo using `create-react-app`.

I've used `create-react-app` as the framework, so that the component is easy for you to run locally, but obviously you could just copy and paste this component into whatever React framework you are using.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, once you've installed all dependencies with `npm install`, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The **Frontend React App** will be running on:
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/ "http://localhost:3000/")

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
